It is designed to be easily recognizable and associated with the company or brand in question. The logo may include elements such as an icon, a logotype, or a combination of both, as well as specific colors and typography that help to differentiate the company or brand from others.',

The favicon is usually a simplified version of the company or brand logo, designed to fit into a very small space, typically 16x16 pixels. Since the space for the favicon is very limited, it is important that it is designed to be easily recognizable, even at a very small size.',
